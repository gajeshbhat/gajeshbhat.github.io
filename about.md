I was born and brought up in a small coastal town in the southwest of India. I have always been excited about learning new things and understanding new ideas. I was interested in working with computers from an early age, and hence my higher education has been mostly in computer science. I also love documenting my experiences in my blog on the art and science of software.

When I do not read about software engineering literature, I like to read non-fiction, history, and political economy. My other hobbies include watching documentaries, listening to podcasts and audiobooks. When I am outdoors, I like to go for a run, hike the nearby mountains and go on long walks in nature parks and trails.
