I am an MSc. Computer Science graduate from Western University. I love working in end-to-end Software Engineering process, including but not limited to Software Requirements, Design, Architecture, Quality and Agile Processes. I have a demonstrated history of leading teams in successful academic projects both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I can articulate technical challenges and solutions effectively and persuasively to handle ambiguous or undefined problems.
