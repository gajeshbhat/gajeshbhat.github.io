My Interest is in end-to-end Software Engineering, including but not limited to Software Requirements, Design, Architecture and Quality.

I have a demonstrated history of leading teams in successful academic projects both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I can articulate technical challenges and solutions effectively and persuasively to handle ambiguous or undefined problems. 

If you think I can add value to your team or organization, please feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn anytime! I am looking forward to talking to you.
